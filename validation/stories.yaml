BBI-RUN-001:
  name: Run NonMem jobs locally
  description: As a user, I would like to be able to execute NonMem jobs locally,
    without needing the grid, if NonMem is installed on the system.
  ProductRisk: High
  requirements:
  - LOCAL-R001
  - LOCAL-R003
BBI-RUN-002:
  name: Run NonMem jobs on the Grid
  description: As a user, I would like to be able to submit NonMem jobs to be run
    on a worker node in the SGE grid.
  ProductRisk: High
  requirements:
  - SGE-R001
  - SGE-R002
BBI-RUN-003:
  name: Notify about issues with the data referenced in the control stream
  description: As a user, I would like to be notified, and have model execution stop,
    if I target a NonMem control stream with bbi, but the data file referenced therein
    cannot be located.
  ProductRisk: Low
  requirements:
  - DATA-R001
  - DATA-R002
  - DATA-R003
BBI-RUN-004:
  name: Pass NMFE options directly to NonMem
  description: As a user, I would like to be able to pass some specified options,
    such as license or compilation options, directly to NonMem, such that they are
    expressed in the final NMFE call.
  ProductRisk: Low
  requirements: LOCAL-R002
BBI-RUN-005:
  name: NonMem Execution via NMQual
  description: As a user, I would like to have the option to execute NonMem the same
    way that autolog.pl did so that NMQual can be used. I would like an option exposed
    that will trigger bbi to specify autolog.pl syntax in its executable script, rather
    than the typical calls directly to NMFE.
  ProductRisk: Low
  requirements: NMQ-R001
BBI-RUN-006:
  name: Capture all configurations and write to a file
  description: As a user, I would like to have all configurations used for each run
    captured in files that can be stored in version control, for the sake of reproducibility.
    The files should contain the merged configurations between any flags provided,
    configuration files and default values to indicate exactly how the model was executed.
  ProductRisk: High
  requirements: CFG-R001
BBI-CFG-001:
  name: Initialize a project with minimum configs required for execution
  description: As a user, I would like to be able to initialize a project with bbi
    without building the config `bbi.yaml` file from scratch. Allowing a command to
    create this file with the minimum default configuration necessary.
  ProductRisk: Medium
  requirements: INIT-R001
BBI-SUM-001:
  name: Parse model output folder
  description: As a user, I want to be able to parse a summary of the files in the
    NonMem output folder into either a human-readable table, or a machine-readable
    structure like `.json`.
  ProductRisk: Medium
  requirements:
  - SUM-R001
  - SUM-R002
  - SUM-R003
  - SUM-R004

  - SUM-R007
BBI-COV-001:
  name: Parse .cov and .cor files
  description: As a user, I want to be able to parse the `.cov` and `.cor` files in
    the NonMem output folder into a machine-readable structure like `.json`.
  ProductRisk: Low
  requirements:
  - COVCOR-R001
  - COVCOR-R002
BBI-SUM-002:
  name: Parse batch parameter estimates
  description: As a user, I would like to be able to parse the final parameter estimates
    from multiple NONMEM model output directories as a batch.
